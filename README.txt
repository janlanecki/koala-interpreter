# Koala Language Interpreter
## Koala is a langugage designed for an academic project combining C and Python syntax and features.

#### Feature list:
* Static typing
* Functions, recursion
* Variable shadowing with static binding
* Nested function definitions with static binding and shadowing
* Generators (yield, next statements)
* Runtime error handling
* Argument passing by value and by reference
* Conditional statements and while loop with break, continue statements
* Printing to stdout
* Four types: int, bool, string, void
* Arithmetic, literals,  variables, assignment, incrementation

##### Running: to run a program written in Koala, first you need to `make` the interpreter. Then either run `interpreter your_program` or just `interpreter` and write your code on standard input.

There are some exemples of both correct and incorrect programs written in Koala in the `good` and `bad` directories. Feel free to check them out in order to quickly get started.
